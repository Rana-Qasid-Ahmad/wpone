<p>Daily WordPress Site Maintenance Checklist</p>



<ol>
<li><strong>Uptime. –&nbsp;</strong>In general, a site’s uptime is the time for which a website appears to be working for the users. Like any website provider, it is essential to keep your website’s uptime as high as possible. Therefore, make it a daily habit to visit your website and stay sure it is working fine. for this purpose, you can also use monitoring services like Uptime Robot,&nbsp;<a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/sitewarranty-verified-seal-trust-seal/">WordPress Monitoring Plugin</a>&nbsp;&amp; many more&nbsp;<a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/tags/monitoring/">wordpress monitoring plugins</a>. To stay updated, the more effective method is to enable SMS notifications from these services.</li>



<li><strong>Take Regular Backups –&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;It is strictly recommended for every WordPress user to keep an offsite backup of the WordPress files and database. WordPress has offered a number of backup plugins that automatically backup your website on a regular basis. You can use plugins like&nbsp;<a href="https://en-au.wordpress.org/plugins/backupwordpress/">BackUpWordPress</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://en-au.wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-backup-to-dropbox/">Backup to Dropbox</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://ithemes.com/purchase/backupbuddy/">BackupBuddy</a></li>



<li><strong>Daily security report.</strong> Use a website security monitoring service (like <a href="https://secure.wphackedhelp.com/">WP Hacked Help</a>) to email you a security report, and send notifications when something suspicious occurs. Check the reports, and act immediately when necessary.</li>
</ol>



<h3 id="weekly-wordpress-maintenance-checklist">Weekly&nbsp;WP Maintenance Checklist</h3>



<ol>
<li><strong>Comment moderation.</strong>&nbsp;This is an important task to be taken care of every week. If there are any comments in the moderation queue, approve them. Keep a check on your spam list for false positives. In case it is a blogging website or service provider and, you receive a lot of comments, you should do this daily. Popular comment plugins are&nbsp;<a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/akismet/">Akismet Anti-Spam</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpdiscuz/">Comments – wpDiscuz</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/disqus-comment-system/">Disqus Comment System</a></li>



<li><strong>Updates (</strong><strong>Update/Delete WordPress Plugins and Themes)</strong>&nbsp;– Keeping your site’s themes and plugins up-to-date is important in order to protect your site from malicious hacks. Likewise, too many themes and plugins can affect your site’s speed. It is recommended that you check in with WordPress for updates and upgrades at least every three months, six months at the most. Check WordPress.org and&nbsp;<a href="https://wordpress.org/download/">Download WordPress</a>&nbsp;for information on the latest&nbsp;<a href="https://secure.wphackedhelp.com/blog/wordpress-releases/">WordPress Releases</a>&nbsp;available.</li>

As such, to steer clear of these <a href="https://secure.wphackedhelp.com/blog/wordpress-vulnerabilities-how-to-fix-guide-tools/">WordPress Vulnerabilities</a>, monitoring your site daily is another task that you need to add to your website maintenance checklist.</li>
</ol>



<h3 id="monthly-wordpress-maintenance-checklist">Monthly&nbsp;WordPress Maintenance Checklist</h3>

Do this on web browsers, including Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari, and Chrome. This will monitor the problems with layout or formatting. Besides, check&nbsp;<a href="https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly">if your website is mobile-friendly</a>.</li>



<li><strong>Verify backups.&nbsp;</strong>To verify your&nbsp;<a href="https://secure.wphackedhelp.com/blog/backup-wordpress-database-plugins/">WordPress site backup</a>&nbsp;is a crucial step of maintenance for those who back up their site on a regular basis.

</ol>



<h3 id="quaterly-wordpress-maintenance-checklist">Quarterly&nbsp;WordPress Maintenance Tasks</h3>



<ol>
<li><strong>Change passwords. –&nbsp;</strong>Use strong passwords that are too hard to guess. If you have a very common password, change now. Also, make other users change their passwords as well for security reasons, as weak passwords is one of the&nbsp;<a href="https://secure.wphackedhelp.com/blog/common-reasons-for-website-hacking-how-to-prevent/">most common reasons for websites getting hacked</a>.</li>



<li><strong>Minimize admin users –&nbsp;</strong>it is important to understand that a hacked admin account can cause the worst damage to your website. Therefore, remove all unnecessary admins from your WordPress account. Only the relevant admins should have access to your site. Additionally,&nbsp;<a href="https://bobwp.com/delete-default-admin-user-name-safely/">delete default wp admin username</a>&nbsp;and restrict the access granted to an admin user depending upon requirements.</li>



<li><strong>Delete unused plugins and themes –&nbsp;</strong>Deactivate all unnecessary plugins and themes as they increase the risk of vulnerabilities. Never remove the latest default WordPress theme.</li>



<li><strong>Delete unnecessary files –&nbsp;</strong>Check for unnecessary files in your wp-content folder and browse through your Media Library. Remove any images, videos and audio files which you no longer require. For this purpose, you can use a plugin like Delete Not Used Image or Media Cleaner to automatically remove broken images. Perform a backup before deleting anything!</li>



<li><strong>Check and Fix Broken Links</strong> – Too many dead links on your website can lead to penalization by Google as well as result in a higher bounce rate. Thus, it is important to check your entire site’s links (download links, social media &#038; affiliate links etc) in order to enhance user experience. Dependent upon the site and number of links on your site, you should check your site for dead links every six months to a year. Use <a href="http://www.deadlinkchecker.com/">Dead Link Checker</a>, <a href="https://www.screamingfrog.co.uk/broken-link-checker/">Screaming Frog</a>, <a href="http://beamusup.com/">Beam Us Up</a>, or check under <em>Crawl &gt; Crawl Errors</em> in <a href="https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/">Google Search Console</a>.

<li><a href="http://www.squarefree.com/bookmarklets/pagelinks.html">Squarefree’s Bookmarklets – javascripts for checking links</a></li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Verify your contact form –&nbsp;</strong>It is essential that the contact form on your website is functioning properly. To make sure, send yourself a message using that form, and check whether you are getting it or not.</li>



<li><strong>Optimize your database –&nbsp;</strong>It is always a good idea to&nbsp;<a href="https://premium.wpmudev.org/blog/optimizing-your-wordpress-database-a-complete-guide/">keep your WP database optimized</a>. Before you do so, delete, if any, draft posts in your database that are not to be published or will never finish. Empty your comment spam. Now, optimize the database. Plugins like&nbsp;<a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-dbmanager/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WP-DBManager</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-optimize/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WP-Optimize</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-clean-up/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WP Clean Up</a>&nbsp;can be used to optimize the database. You can also optimize using the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.phpmyadmin.net/">phpMyAdmin</a>&nbsp;tool available in cPanel. It is the simplest way to update and optimize your WordPress database.</li>



<li><strong>Check Your Site’s Speed</strong> – Google takes into account website speed when ranking a website. A sluggish page speed and load time can frustrate users, leading to higher bounce rate. Thus, testing your site’s speed is a maintenance task that you need to do on a regular basis. Use Pingdom or Google PageSpeed Insights to examine how fast your site loads.</li>
